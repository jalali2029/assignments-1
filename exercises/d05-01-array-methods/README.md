# Array Methods Exercise

Create a new JavaScript file and put these two arrays at the beginning. You will perform operations with them.

```
var fruit = ["banana", "apple", "orange", "watermelon"];  
var vegetables = ["carrot", "tomato", "pepper", "lettuce"];  
```

After every command, console.log() your arrays.
