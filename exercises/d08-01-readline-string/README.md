# String Manipulation

The purpose of this exercise is to get you comfortable using the terminal with node, npm, and your text editor. You will learn the basics of string manipulation and how to find things on the Internet.

Using the NodeJS package readline-sync, create an interactive program that asks you some personal information (name, age, favorite color, etc.) and reports back to you what you entered. Make sure to include the following string manipulations:

* Make one of the inputs all uppercase (i.e., given the string “hello” prints “HELLO”)
* Report back the number of characters in a given input
* Concatenate (add) two separate strings together
* Given a long message (more than twenty letters), return only the last half of the message
* Using the same long message (but without making the user type it in again), have your program print it to the terminal for the user to read again, but allow the user to tell your program where to begin typing from (i.e., which index to start from).
